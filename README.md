## Summary

### Target Audience:

•Our database will target camping enthusiasts who are planning their adventures in Colorado.

### Database Information:

•Identify the location of camping facilities within Colorado, by region.
•Quantify the availability of spaces.
•Highlight the average reservation lead time required for booking.
•Retrieve the quantity of spaces available and of those, which are designated as RV only camping, tent only camping, or both.

### Our team identified two sources for our data:

•Recreation.gov provides outdoor enthusiasts with the opportunity to plan and reserve recreational activities throughout the US.  Activities include camping, lodging, tickets, tours, permits, and passes.  Recreation.gov provides access to their historical reservation data as .csv files, we will focus on 2010 - 2020 (https://ridb.recreation.gov).

•National Park Service Visitor User Statistics is a collection of .csv files providing a myriad of statistics on the ways in which the respective National Park are accessed and / or utilized.  We will focus on ‘Overnight Stays’ from 2010 – 2020 for the four National Parks located in Colorado (https://irma.nps.gov/STATS).
